# JSONSEARCH
### Live search and sort multiple JSON data files 

This script, built entirely using pure JavaScript without any third-party libraries or tools, performs a price comparison by sourcing data from multiple local JSON files. The JSON files contain information on store products and their pricing, each following the same key/value formatting structure, which allows for seamless data merging.
      
The example demonstrates a product pricing and sale item comparison between two stores (two JSON files/datasets), though the number of sources is highly expandable. An effective keyword matching strategy is implemented for filtering and searching operations, ensuring accuracy and relevancy of results. Users can input additional search keywords to further narrow down the search results, allowing them to pinpoint the exact product they are looking for.
        
To enhance performance and user experience, the script incorporates an infinite scrolling feature. As users scroll down the page, more results are incrementally loaded and displayed, providing a seamless browsing experience. This approach significantly reduces initial load times and ensures optimal performance, even when handling large datasets.
