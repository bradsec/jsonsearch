# JSONSEARCH
### Live search and sort multiple JSON data files 

This script, built entirely using pure JavaScript without any third-party libraries or tools, performs a price comparison by sourcing data from multiple local JSON files. The JSON files contain information on store products and their pricing, each following the same key/value formatting structure, which allows for seamless data merging.
      
The live demonstrates shows a mock product pricing and sale comparison between two stores (using two JSON files/datasets).
