# JSON Search and Sort
### Live search and sort one or more JSON data files 

This script, built entirely using pure JavaScript without any third-party libraries or tools, performs a price comparison by sourcing data from multiple local JSON files. The JSON files contain information on store products and their pricing, each following the same key/value formatting structure, which allows for seamless data merging.

### Features

- Load and search multiple json files/datasets.
- Uses flat files, no database or API (however can be modified for these use cases).
- Effective keyword matching ensuring accuracy and relevancy of results. 
- Users can input additional search keywords to further narrow down the search results.
- Also includes ability to sort by JSON keys or values.
- To enhance performance and user experience, the script incorporates an infinite scrolling feature.

The live demo shows a mock product pricing and sale comparison between two stores (using two JSON files/datasets).
